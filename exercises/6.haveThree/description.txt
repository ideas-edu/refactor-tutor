Given an array of ints, return true if the value 3 appears in the array exactly 3 times, and no 3's are next to each other.
Example test cases:<br>haveThree with {3, 1, 3, 1, 3} returns true<br>haveThree with {3, 1, 3, 3} returns false<br>haveThree with {3, 4, 3, 3, 4} returns false
For this problem you have to write the code yourself. When the solution is correct and all test cases pass, you can check if there are hints to improve your program.
