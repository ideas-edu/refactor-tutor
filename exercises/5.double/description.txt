Write a program that calculates in how many years your savings have doubled with the given interest (as a percentage).
An example: if your savings are 1000 euros and the interest is 4%, it will take you 18 years to double your savings (then you'll have more than 2000 euros).
The solution is already correct, but can you improve this program?
