The calculateScore method calculates the score for a train trip. The highest score is 10. The score is based on the number of changes and the day of the week (Monday is 1, Sunday is 7). 

Dutch Railways (NS) has designed the following calculation:
Base score: 10 
For each change: -1 
Trip on a weekday: -3 

Example test case: for a trip with 2 changes on a Wednesday (day 3), calculateScore(2, 3) returns a score of 5 (10-2-3)

The code is already correct, but can you improve this program?
