Welcome to the refactor tutor wiki!

If you want to use the refactor tutor yourself you will have to host it somewhere. There are two guides for setting up the refactor tutor:

- [Using docker to host an all-in-one image](instructions-docker.md)
- [Instructions for self hosting using Apache 2](instructions-apache2.md)
